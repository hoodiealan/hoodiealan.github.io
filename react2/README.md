# Welcome!

This is my personal website, deployed in React. Here's my to-do list:

    * Reorganize mobile breakpoints.
    * Create sidebar.js and sidebar.scss in src/layouts.
    * Create some sort of dropdown for the sidebar.
    * Have some sort of loading symbol before presenting all available information.
    * Implement redux if necessary.
    * Reorganize how I present my .md information in the movies section.
    * Incorporate animations and make my website feel more responsive.
