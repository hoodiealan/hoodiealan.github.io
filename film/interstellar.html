	<h1><i>Interstellar</i></h1>

	<p id=copy>*This was an article published in the November '14 issue of <i>The Raider Review</i>.</p>

	<p>“We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible,” said the ambitious Cooper played by Matthew McConaughey. “And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known.”</p>

	<p>We overcame the impossible when we made our first step on the moon. Christopher Nolan, in his space epic <i>Interstellar</i>, awakens the pioneer in us and takes us to infinity and beyond. Science fiction as a whole has been relatively stale, but this film revives the genre with its dazzling visuals and physics-heavy ideals. Nolan takes us beyond our understanding of space travel in one carefully crafted movie.</p>

	<p><i>Interstellar</i> begins with a haunting, near-apocalyptic Earth with poor living conditions, the severe blight spewing specks of dust across the crop fields as rural Americans are decked in blue jeans, leather jackets, and protective masks. Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a remarkable pilot turned farmer who struggles to maintain adequate living. He is devoted to his young daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) who shares his passion for space exploration. His son Tom (Casey Affleck) on the other hand is on the way to adulthood, looking forward to following his father’s footsteps, taking care of the farmhouse.</p>

	<p>Given the dust storms destroying the main source of food, corn, it is likely that humanity will become extinct in the near future. But one day, Cooper accidentally stumbles upon a secret NASA station and reluctantly agrees to go on a trek across space to seek a more tolerable planet for the Earth’s population. Cooper, however, is faced with the dreaded decision of leaving his kids behind. He proceeds to join a space mission with his fellow peers Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Doyle (Wes Bentley), Romilly (David Gyasi), and the humorous robot companion TARS.</p>

	<p>Cooper sails the Endurance in the void, accompanied by ravishing stars. Here in space, Nolan presents us with his magnificent work of art. The audience has a front row seat of the spectacle space provides as the crew travels to Saturn in order to enter a wormhole. Scientific anomalies like the black hole, tesseract, and the fifth dimension are all shown beautifully on the big screen. After jumping into another galaxy, the Endurance enters two entirely unique worlds, encountering mountain-size waves and frozen clouds.</p>

	<p>What is fascinating about Nolan’s universe is the impeccable scientific accuracy. Kip Thorne, a theoretical physicist, assisted in the film’s astrophysics, creating precise images throughout of space’s wonders, like the wormhole and singularity. Unlike other science fiction movies like Star Trek and Guardians of the Galaxy, or highly regarded space operas, <i>Interstellar</i> breaks barriers with its striking realism. There are no aliens, no UFOs, no superpowers. Just science at its best.</p>

	<p>Technology is a terrific character of its own. Known for intriguing, menacing soundtracks, Hans Zimmer guides the audience through danger and hope, one emotion at a time. Hoyte Van Hoyema shoots the movie sets with finesse, leaving the viewer captivated by multiple sceneries. Nathan Crowley and Bill Irwin are the masterminds behind TARS who bring it to life. Technology is exploited successfully to an absolute maximum.</p>

	<p>From <i>Memento</i> to <i>Inception</i>, Nolan is the master of nonlinear storylines. Numerous cross cuts between Earth and space, along with flashbacks, are utilized in a flawless fashion to have a more engaging plot. Despite the prolonged running time of three hours, occasional cheesy dialogue, and glaring plot issues, Nolan is able to make it work. During those hours, sitting in a theater (preferably IMAX), we are immersed in an entirely different world, eyes glued to every tiny bit of the screen. And that is what makes a good movie.</p>

	<p>Christopher Nolan’s <i>Interstellar</i> will be the the world’s pioneer to a more hopeful future pertaining to adventure and novelty; a pioneer for the great depths of space.
