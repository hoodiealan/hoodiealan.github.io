	<h1><i>Ex Machina</i></h1>

	<p id=copy>*This was an article published in the April '15 issue of <i>The Raider Review</i>.</p>

	<p>Meet Ava. She’s a beautiful, kind female with a voice as soft and clear as her pale skin, who speaks with curiosity under her tongue. She speaks to you as if she truly understands you and connects with you. But here’s the catch: she’s a robot. Ava, voiced gracefully by Alicia Vakander, in fact knows you more than anybody else—thanks to your results through the world’s most popular search engine.</p>


	<p>Alex Garland’s sci-fi debut <i>Ex Machina</i> seeks to “erase the line between man and machine” through Ava. This piece of artificial intelligence, constructed by the reclusive engineer Nathan (Oscar Isaac), is the next step towards the digital frontier. Nathan wants to share his marvelous creation with a lucky Bluebook employee through a staff lottery. Situated in his office, Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) receives a text saying that he won. Ecstatic as ever, we see him hovering in a helicopter around a peaceful estate, ready to spend a week with Nathan.</p>


	<p>Caleb is the human component of the Turing Test: he is to engage in friendly, natural conversation with Ava, and determine whether she passes as a human being or not. Ava at first sight is wonderful; she is a kind female who enjoys drawing, fashion, and city life. However, not everything is what it seems. The question eventually pops up: “What if Ava is actually pretending to like you?” Guided by Garland’s masterly script, the interaction between the three lead characters soon become laced with skepticism and especially aversion.</p>


	<p>The triple threat pack quite a punch in Ex Machina. Gleeland carefully establishes himself as an awkward and easily manipulated individual who speaks in superfluous language. Isaac electrifies his performance as Nathan: an alcoholic, athletic genius who objectifies women and manifests the god complex. However, Vakander proves to be the star of the show. Garland’s portrayal of Ava is parallel to our ideal significant other (otherwise dubbed as the manic pixie dream girl/guy): shared interests, sexual attraction, and the will to spend life with each other indefinitely—and we fall in love with her, just like Caleb.</p>


	<p><i>Ex Machina</i> is the epitome of immaculate production design. With Rob Hardy’s flawless camera work, we immerse in the beautiful scenery in and out of the estate: a luxurious, glossy white architecture surrounded by a serene mountain range. Moreover, the film’s soundtrack helps provide an eerie atmosphere upon the estate regardless of its tranquil chimes.</p>


	<p>Garland may have kicked off the season with his refreshing, original piece of science fiction -- something the film industry desperately needs more of. It is inherently smart in its approach to scholarly topics such as Mary’s Room and avoiding the typical Hollywood sci-fi cliches. Comprising of an ideal post-modern production design, stellar cast, and jaw-dropping plot, Ex Machina is truly one of 2015’s cinematic masterpieces.</p>
