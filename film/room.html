	<h1><i>Room</i></h1>

	<p id=copy>*This was my first movie review in post-high school education, finished in Fall '15.</p>

	<p>“Truck. Wiggle out. Jump. Run. Somebody.</p>

	<p>Lenny Abrahamson’s <i>Room</i> is not just a story of primitive living; it is Emma Donoghue’s critically-acclaimed novel of growth in an enclosed room between a mother and son. And it blossoms into something much more -- a plant, a flower. The dynamic duo between Abrahamson’s melodramatic direction and Donoghue’s brilliant story sheds light on the beauty of life and growth.</p>

	<p>This is Donoghue’s story (and her first screenplay). Like Abrahamson’s previous films What Richard Did and Frank, Room is a dynamic character study under harrowing circumstances. It is the testing ground between a mother and son. It is the unfolding of life through Jack’s (Jacob Tremblay) five-year-old perspective. 
	The opening scene begins with muted, blue colors and abrupt cuts of this enclosed room. To Jack, the beauty of life is bestowed upon a small, decrepit garden shed. His narration accompanies what he sees when he first starts the day: his friends Lamp, Chair, and Sink. They all share the same world with him that is Room. They are real unlike the people shown on television, and outside Room, which is “outer space.” He is five years old. Five years, he is in Room with his best friend: Ma (Brie Larson). His daily routines consist of greeting his friends, brushing his teeth, eating cereal and other simple meals, performing exercises and stretches, and reading books and playing games with Ma. They share their intricate lives together by means of nurture and illusive comfort.</p>

	<p>And then one day, they escape.</p>

	<p>They are now in “outer space,” or what we call: Earth. Society.</p>

	<p>Abrahamson is able to capture the intensity and uncertainty to both Jack and Ma for time seems to be nonexistent, seemingless, in this 118-minute film. Abrahamson successfully pulls our heart strings with his symbolic composition (as comparable to Terrence Malick’s <i>The Tree of Life</i>) and intimate melodrama. He allows us to feel the pain that Ma holds as she faces imprisonment inside a tiny, frail room, meanwhile Jack playfully indulges in his own world. Donoghue’s novel provides insight to blissful ignorance and imprisonment of both the physical and mental states. Abrahamson translates Donoghue’s unique narration meticulously onto the big screen, and provides a heartfelt cinematic experience like no other.</p>

	<p>What adds to such an intense experience is genuine acting -- especially Larson and Tremblay. The story and situation all seem real. Tremblay evokes his lurking curiosity of Room and the lives of fake “television” people. He delivers such careful, innocent questions throughout the duration of the film, from Room, to outer space. His mesmerizing gaze also evokes this sense of curiosity as cared for, so lovingly by Larson’s wondrous motherly figure. She embodies the true love of mother and son, and wishes for nothing but the best for Jack. However, her facial expressions also linger a sense of despair. She is traumatized by her drawn-out abduction and loss of hope.</p>

	<p>While Larson and Tremblay’s acting are both Oscar-worthy, Joan Allen as Nancy and Matt Gordon as Doug serve to be phenomenal supporting cast members. As parental figures, they help the two assimilate to modern culture and provide everlasting warmth. Moreover, Sean Bridgers as Old Nick—as Ma calls her rapist—epitomizes a touchy, sex-driven thing. He is shown as the dominant figure, yet somewhat caring as he provides basic needs for survival. Ma displays such resentment towards him during every moment of contact whether it is with her or Jack. The cast and their compelling acting further captivate our feelings throughout the film.</p>

	<p><i>Room</i>’s camera work is favorable. As previously an Oscar nominee in cinematography for <i>The King’s Speech</i>, Danny Cohen allows us to see the beauty in life. From close-up shots of leaves to touch, Cohen bestows on us the grace that the world offers us, to Ma, to Jack. Room is shown primarily through close and medium shots, given its cramped, confined space. Yet Cohen is able to make Room seem vast, beyond such a small room. On the other spectrum, outer space is a much bigger feat—overwhelming—to Jack’s eyes as long shots of the city are prevalent throughout the second half of the film. Cohen smoothly provides the bridge between imprisonment and freedom in the film’s unconventional two-act structure.</p>

	<p>The concept of imprisonment and freedom is in fact expressed in color and deviation from the norm. Room is filled with muted, blue colors indicating distress, and the outside world is portrayed with multitudes of vibrant colors. Room addresses the fishbowl analogy, or in specific terms: Plato’s Allegory of the Cave. Having accustomed to a subpar way of life inside a small boxlike room, the second act of Room chronicles Jack’s overwhelming perception of his new reality. His life is not just hoping for his nonexistent dog Lucky to come, or making egg shells with Ma; it is him learning how to play with Legos and walk down the stairs. It is Jack learning how to live in a bigger, modern Room. Simultaneously, the second act is also about Ma struggling to contain her post-traumatic stress disorder. She is still trapped in her own little Room. Donoghue’s unique story and careful depiction of imprisonment and freedom deem Room Oscar-worthy of “Best Original Screenplay.”
	Stephen Rennick’s musical contribution perfectly resonates innocent growth in our ears. We are pleasantly graced with soft, optimistic piano and violin sounds, reaching for nostalgia as Jack’s life unfolds. Through Jack baking a birthday cake, playing with a toy truck, and reading Alice in Wonderland with Ma, Rennick elegantly hints at blissful child rearing. However, the musical score fails to show much creativity, recycling the same melodies (although exemplary) throughout.</p>

	<p>We replay our child youth as Room runs its 118-minute screening. We are happy, angry, depressed, confused, disgusted as our parental figures guide us through life, whether we are inside our own little Room, or out in the real world. And our eyes are in total awe in front of what life offers us. It isn’t just the plethora of tall buildings out downtown, or the beautiful, fall nature of leaves and redwood trees.</p>

	<p>It is the magnificent acting that both Larson and Tremblay add to the table. It is the artistic composition that both Abrahamson and Cohen add with their respective directing and cinematography. It is the innocence that Rennick instills in us with his musical score. It is Donoghue’s unique screenplay.  It is a quality film. This is what Lenny Abrahamson’s <i>Room</i> is: a beautiful color-oriented melodrama that depicts storge love and the growth that a child everlastingly withstands.</p>
