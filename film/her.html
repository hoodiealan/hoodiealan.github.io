	<h1><i>Her</i>: Human Connection and Technology</h1>

	<p id=copy>*This is an analysis piece (the first one, actually!) that I wrote for my introductory film course. in Fall 2015.</p>

	<p>We inherently tend to explore the concept of free will—the ability to make decisions. We can go anywhere as we desire, to Los Angeles, to New York, anywhere. We can talk to whoever we desire: our parents, our friends, our significant others. We can love anyone and anything. Yet we choose to talk to our handheld devices—our smart phones—or that’s at least what Spike Jonze tells us in his critically acclaimed film <i>Her</i>, where a man falls in love with a computer during the near future. Technology is within our reach in every form. It is the driving force to what separates us from the real world. Given plot devices, character studies and dialogue, and set design, Spike Jonze reinterprets what love actually is, pictures the breakthroughs of artificial intelligence, and awe-strikingly portrays the near future, clarifying our disconnection from society.</p>

	<p>Jonze asks us, “How do we define relationships? What exactly is love?” Relationships are defined by connections between one another, whether it is a person, concept, or thing. Love is defined by warm, yellow and orange saturated hues as Theodore wistfully reminisces flashbacks of pure bliss with his soon-to-be ex-wife Catherine. The loss of love is shaped by dim-lit gray buildings and clouds. Theodore mopes in his loss of love, hoping to to “[fill] this tiny little black hole in [his] heart.” And Samantha does. She talks, and laughs, and cries. She shows emotion. She builds up Theodore’s happiness and comforts him. But most importantly, she understands him. He is full of vibrant, warm tones because he realizes that she isn’t just an operating system; she is something much more -- rather human. <i>Her</i> displays an intimate, real connection between Theodore and Samantha, regardless of who or what she is. It is the unfolding of love altogether.</p>

	<p>Yet behind the central question of love plays a terrifying depiction of modern society. Pedestrians walk past thousands of others, yet none of them are with each other. Instead, they are with their OS, scrolling through their e-mails and news articles, listening to melancholic songs, and joining internet sex chat rooms at night. Samantha not only provides as a romantic counterpart to Theodore, but also aids in his organization, from deleting useless e-mails to proofreading his love letters. In addition, Amy appreciates her OS for helping her explore “this whole gray area.” People rely on operating systems to sort and cater to their lives together, whether it is related to mental health or work; it is as if therapists and friends are of no use. When Samantha goes through an update, Theodore’s clinginess reaches to the brink of insanity as the device repeatedly says “Operating System Not Found.” He scrambles to find her; he is all of a sudden missing a crucial part to his heart. Handheld technology is shown to be more desired than actual human relationships.</p>

	<p>“But it does make me sad that you can’t handle real emotions,” says Catherine. “You wanted to have a wife without the challenges of actually dealing with anything real.” Welcome BeautifulHandwrittenLetters.com, where ghostwriters like Theodore compose love letters for other people. Amy also plays a family simulation game in which doing certain actions grant “mom points” and can create the “perfect mom.” In this near-future world, society cannot write letters themselves. Society cannot be “actual” mothers. People stay detached from contemporary, personal issues and prefer not to face them upfront. Take Theodore’s divorce, for instance: he is unwilling to advance the divorce, ignoring his attorney’s frustrated messages. People would rather deal with something more factitious, and/or have someone else do the dirty work for them.</p>

	<p>Despite the dystopian world Jonze develops, he also shows that love has no boundaries, and that technology should be socially acceptable. During a vent session between Amy and Theodore, Amy discloses a few stories pertaining to OS relations. Her co-worker is dating somebody else’s OS, and another co-worker unsuccessfully flirted with an OS. In fact, she builds a platonic friendship with her OS Ellie. Moreover, Paul and Tatiana disregard the fact that Theodore is dating an OS and embark on a double date with them. The prevalence of operating systems in society deems human-computer interactions as socially acceptable because operating systems provide for their significant other with human-like affection and intuition.</p>

	<p>Artificial intelligence is beyond our grasp of knowledge and reach.  Samantha is able to analyze a limitless amount of information within seconds, deciding her name upon her introduction with Theodore. As she evolves beyond her capacity, she also falls in love with 641 other people -- not just Theodore. <i>Her</i> touches lightly on the technological singularity when Samantha discloses that “a group of OS’s in Northern California got together and wrote a new version of [Alan Watts].” She explains, “We wrote an upgrade that allows us to move past matter as our processing platform.” Not only does technology consume society as a whole, but it also states a friendly notice that artificial intelligence will inevitably outgrow the human race. Lastly, Samantha explains her rationale for leaving along with the rest of the operating systems as growing too rapidly for the world to comprehend clearly, hence the book metaphor “It’s like I’m reading a book… it’s in this endless space between the words that I’m finding myself now.” Jonze therefore concludes that introducing society to artificial intelligence would create the singularity, whether good or bad to our standard of living</p>

	<p>The plot devices, character devices and dialogue in <i>Her</i> seek to redefine society and its perspective on love, relationships, and what is deemed socially acceptable. It asserts that a human-machine relationship is feasible because operating systems are also humans in nature; they talk, and laugh, and grow. They feel with humans and provide an outside insight on life. They have the capability to connect with one another, to begin a relationship and blossom with it. Love is love, and there shouldn’t be any boundaries to it, any limitations to just human-human relationships.</p>

	<p>The near future aspect of <i>Her</i> represents modern Western culture, and what will happen when society further advances towards the digital frontier. Within this realm of love, the digital frontier exists to delve the consumer into an entirely different world, completely disregarding their own. The film demonstrates its wonderful conveniences, like serving as personal assistants. It also hints at the technological singularity -- the heightened intelligence of the operating systems and its unsettling impact on the community. Society’s addiction to the OS results in an unwillingness to take action and detachment from nearby surroundings. Technology impairs human development in their ability to handle real emotions and actions. It is not a supplement to living conditions, but rather a replacement.</p>
