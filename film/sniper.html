	<h1><i>American Sniper</i></h1>

	<p id=copy>*This was an article published in the January '15 issue of <i>The Raider Review</i>.</p>

	<p>Chris Kyle is the most lethal sniper in U.S. history with 160 confirmed kills. A tale of blatant patriotism and fear, Clint Eastwood’s <i>American Sniper</i> is a direct account of the Iraq War through Kyle’s scopes and how he grows. The reality of war takes a toll on veterans, as the combat-scarred Kyle progressively sinks to despair throughout his four tours of duty.</p>


	<p>The movie begins with Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) scouting over a child, who is carrying a grenade. The tension builds as he slowly takes aim on the child and places his finger on the trigger. His first confirmed kill. Then the movie abruptly flashes back to glimpses of Kyle’s past. A crucial flashback in which Kyle’s father categorizes people into three types—sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs—shapes Kyle’s ideals on protecting his loved ones. Thereafter, Kyle lives the Texan dream, hunting deer and entering rodeo competitions.</p>


	<p>Kyle proceeds to enlist in the Navy SEALS, undergoing merciless training and developing his killer instincts. After passing the Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) test, he meets Taya (Sienna Miller) at a bar and forges a relationship with her, despite her distrust of “arrogant, self-centered pricks” such as the SEALS. As a SEAL, Kyle’s main duty is to protect his country at all costs, and does so following the 9/11 attacks. He is deployed to Iraq and establishes his mark as the “legend”, killing 160 Iraqi insurgents with pinpoint accuracy, but more importantly saving fellow soldiers.</p>


	<p><i>American Sniper</i> portrays the Iraq War as straining and bloody. For instance, one of the antagonists nicknamed “The Butcher,” executes Iraqis with a handheld power drill. Gunshots are fired everywhere in the dunes and soldiers always have to be aware of their surroundings. The movie as a whole is anti-war because it illustrates heavily traumatizing events through Kyle’s perspective; yet it is American propaganda as Kyle firmly has the need to protect his country from evil at all costs.</p>


	<p>Cooper’s electrifying performance captures the veteran’s dismay preceding strenuous, life-threatening battles. <i>American Sniper</i> sheds light on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and how it affects Kyle and his family. Back at home, during his leaves from the military, Kyle struggles to readjust to civilian life and finds himself longing to rush back to Iraq and protect his comrades. He also neglects his wife and avoids wartime discussion. Eastwood intentionally creates no chemistry between Kyle and Taya to establish how draining war can be after experiencing the morbid reality.</p>


	<p>Yet Eastwood altogether fails to provide much character development into the movie. Kyle is shown to be a one-sided SEAL who stays firm to his sheepdog instinct, protecting loved ones from danger, while slowly descending into the abyss. There is absolutely nothing to Tara other than her affection for her husband and kids, and her blatant irritation for Kyle during his leaves. Kyle’s family and friends appear to have no personality; they are just background noise to him.</p>


	<p>It is fascinating how <i>American Sniper</i> was nominated for 6 Oscars, including: Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Bradley Cooper), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing, because the movie itself is not extraordinary, not spectacular. The lackluster plot and character development serve as an obstacle to the movie’s success. There is nothing outstandingly unique about its film and sound editing; it is rather generic. Cooper however creates an exceptional performance despite Eastwood’s mediocre directing. In short, <i>American Sniper</i> does not live up to its merit like <i>Birdman</i> and <i>The Grand Budapest Hotel</i> (9 nominations each). It does not deserve any Oscar nominations other than Best Actor. It is simply an average war flick that provokes little to no emotions, not a reincarnation of <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> or <i>The Hurt Locker.</i> </p>
