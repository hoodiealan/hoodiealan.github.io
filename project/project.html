	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p>In my spare time, I've been self-studying concepts regarding intermediate statistics and machine learning. Here, you will see a portfolio of what I've done so far. I've recently started programming this year, so there will be more projects to come!</p>

	<h2>Discord</h2>
	<table width=100%><tr>
	<td><img src="photos/discord.png" class=project></td>
	<td style="padding-left: 5%" valign=top><p>I built an interactive bot, written in Python, intended for use on the application <b>Discord.</b> The bot joins a channel of its choice and can interact with guests by playing Hangman, Magic 8 Ball, Guessing Game, and more. It also gathers random images from Google and posts them in the channel by request.</p></td></tr></table>

	<h2>Reddit</h2>
	<table width=100%><tr>
	<td><img src="photos/reddit.png" class=project></td>
	<td style="padding-left:5%" valign=top><p>I helped write a <b>Reddit</b> bot in Python. It processes Reddit's comment database, formatted by JSON, and then learns how to create original content from such by using recurrent neural networks and more specifically a Sequence-to-Sequence model, given both the TensorFlow and PRAW API.</p></td></tr></table>

	<h2>restock.</h2>
	<p>I created a script that notifies me automatically by e-mail if there is any change in a given website. I originally used this in order to keep track of sneaker and limited clothing updates regarding several brands.</p>
