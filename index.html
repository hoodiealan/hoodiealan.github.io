		<h1>Alan Nguyen</h1>
		<p>Hello there!</p>

		<p>I'm a second-year undergraduate student currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area. My main interests primarily lie in both mathematics and computer science. I am deeply passionate about artificial intelligence and machine learning, and hope to apply them onto fields like technology and finance!</p>

		<p>I also consider the arts my guilty pleasure. In here, you will see a collection of recent films that I've past watched, as well as a portfolio of my most recent photos.</p>
