		<h1>Alan Nguyen</h1>
		<p>Hello there! I'm a third-year undergraduate student currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area. My main interests primarily lie in both mathematics and computer science. I am deeply passionate about artificial intelligence and machine learning, and hope to apply them onto fields like technology and finance!

		<p>I also consider the visual arts my guilty pleasure; photography and film in its entirety are two ways to truly express myself. In here, you will see a collection of recent films that I've past watched, as well as a portfolio of my most recent photos.</p>
