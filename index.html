<p>Hello there! I'm a second-year undergraduate student based in the San Francisco Bay Area. My main interests lie in Statistics, Economics, and Film.</p>

<p>I consider the visual arts my guilty pleasure; photography and film in its entirety are two ways to truly express oneself. Through the lens can one make so much meaning. In here, you will see a collection of recent films that I have past watched (and my personal ratings), as well as a portfolio of the past photos I have taken.</p>

<p>I also am deeply vested in the realm of numbers, where I enjoy pondering about the infinite stacks of data that we face today. I hope to decipher what that data really means, and make an impact on <i>our</i> world, someday.</p>
