# Welcome!

This is my personal website that I am currently working on. I'll be issuing what needs to be changed.


	* Be able to exclude my sidebar from accessing core.js
	* Work on bordering my images with CSS
	* Add images and table/font wraps in film/... 
		* Add a class, separating film index and specific images. Maybe use html sizing for specific images.
	* Add analysis pieces for LoT and Synecdoche
	* _Short_ reviews for Moonlight, Arrival
