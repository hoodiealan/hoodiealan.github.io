	<h1><i>Gone Girl</i></h1>

	<p id=copy>*This was a (mediocre) article published in the October '14 issue of <i>The Raider Review</i>.</p>

	<p>There are two sides to every story. In David Fincher’s recreation of Gillian Flynn’s novel <i>Gone Girl</i>, conflicting narratives create massive confusion among the Dunne family, shown by news involvement.</p>

	<p>The movie <i>Gone Girl</i> centers around a faulty marriage and the husband’s involvement in the crime. Ben Affleck plays a mysterious spouse named Nick Dunne who goes through a crisis following his wife’s disappearance on their fifth anniversary. He then calls for a widespread search for his wife, while dealing with ruthless interrogation by both the media and police. Rosamund Pike plays Amy Dunne who fears for her life and her husband’s abusive actions. But Dunne tells another side of the story about how he was at first in love with his wife and how the marriage failed.</p>

	<p>It is later reported by the news that Nick is directly involved with the disappearance. Intensive media coverage creates chaos throughout the community, regarding the husband’s morals. As Sharon Schieber, an acclaimed newswoman in Gone Girl, simply puts, Nick Dunne is “probably the most hated man in America.” At one point, Dunne is regarded as truly innocent and framed for the murder of his wife. Another scene compares him to the devil and should be sent to prison for his heinous crimes.</p>

	<p>The technical aspects of the film altogether created a magnificent piece of art that is <i>Gone Girl</i>. Fincher’s nonlinear storyline intentionally confuses the audience, leading them unsure of who to trust. The outstanding cinematography, coupled with the eerie soundtrack creates a sense of fear and disorientation in the city, as well as the main characters.</p>

	<p>Fincher’s remarkable direction along with both Affleck’s and Pike’s acting is currently igniting speculation regarding multiple Oscar nominations. Despite the lengthy runtime of 149 minutes, the audience is able to indulge in every little detail the film offers and sit for about three hours of excitement. Critics say that <i>Gone Girl</i> is just as genius as his past work The Social Network for being extremely cynical and executing unreliable narration perfectly. They also claim that the film is just as good as the book, if not better. It would not be surprising that the Gone Girl cast wins an Oscar for multiple achievements.</p>

	<p>Fincher invites the audience to be on the edge of their seat, teeth rattling, and mouth covered, trying to solve the answer to these questions: Is Nick Dunne innocent? Will Amy Dunne come back?</p>
