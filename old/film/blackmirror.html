	<h1><i>Black Mirror</i></h1>

	<p id=copy>*This was an article published in the January '15 issue of <i>The Raider Review</i>.</p>

	<p>Imagine a world where you have the ability to record every action you take and replay it,  make contact with the deceased online, or permanently erase people from your life. What would you do with that power? Charlie Brooker's <i>Black Mirror</i>, dubbed the “modern <i>Twilight Zone</i>,” explores the dark side of life and technology in the near future. 

	<p>There are a total of seven independent episodes and each presents an entirely different world -- distinct cast, production, and most importantly plot. One episode features a politician being ransomed to have intercourse with a pig. Another features a depressed male trying to make a living in a sleek, dystopian world, and so on. Brooker questions society as a whole and creates fictional worlds in which deeply haunting outcomes are portrayed realistically.</p>

	<p><i>Black Mirror</i>’s most appealing factor is its backdrop. All of the plot foundations such as memory implants, technological dystopia, mass hysteria are plausible and may even occur in the near future. For example, the episode White Bear features a brainwashing signal that hypnotizes the public into recording unaffected people. Imagine the entire world watching your every move, silent, and you, having no memory of events past, frightened and desperate for answers. These events are fictional yet have the potential to be reasonable, which is what draws the audience in.</p>

	<p>Brooker unleashes the dark side of society as his characters commit diabolical crimes against common morals. If we were given the technology, we would join the characters in their villainous deeds. The episode Be Right Back pictures a distraught widow longing for her husband, and communicates with him through experimental means. But dwelling in the past is known to be bad, and such conversation goes downhill. We will also erase our enemies from their lives, having complete disregard for them. Or we’ll obsess over our replayed memories like stalking our ex-girlfriends on Facebook five times a night. </p>

	<p>Though the new season has not been released yet, the previous episodes are good enough to draw you in for a haunting adventure. After reading this article and getting home from school, go on Netflix and look up Black Mirror. Watch any episode that appeals to you. Think about it for hours afterwards, about how you would feel in the same situation as the main character, about the dark side of modern life and how one day you may experience it. You won’t be disappointed.</p>
